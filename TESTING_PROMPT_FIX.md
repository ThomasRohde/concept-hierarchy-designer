# Testing Prompt Selection Fix

## Issue
The magic wand button on nodes was not using the active prompt selected in either:
1. **PromptsPage** - when selecting a prompt with the "Use" button
2. **MainContent** - when selecting a prompt from the dropdown

## Fix Applied
1. **Enhanced `useMagicWand` hook** with localStorage synchronization and custom events
2. **Updated prompt selection handlers** in AppRouter and TreeControls to properly sync state
3. **Added custom event system** for same-tab communication between hook instances

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: Prompt Selection from PromptsPage
1. Open the app at `http://localhost:5173/`
2. Navigate to the **Prompts** page (via burger menu or direct URL `/prompts`)
3. Select a different prompt (e.g., "Academic Research") by clicking **"Use"**
4. Navigate back to the main page
5. Click the magic wand on any node
6. **Expected**: The copied prompt should use the "Academic Research" guidelines

### Test 2: Prompt Selection from MainContent Dropdown
1. On the main page, find the prompt dropdown in the TreeControls area
2. Click the dropdown and select a different prompt (e.g., "Business Strategy")
3. Immediately click the magic wand on any node
4. **Expected**: The copied prompt should use the "Business Strategy" guidelines

### Test 3: Cross-Component Synchronization
1. Open the prompt dropdown and select "Creative Writing"
2. Navigate to the Prompts page
3. **Expected**: "Creative Writing" should be marked as active (blue background, "Active" button)
4. Navigate back and verify the magic wand still uses "Creative Writing"

### Test 4: Legacy Migration (if applicable)
1. Clear localStorage in browser dev tools
2. Set a legacy prompt: `localStorage.setItem('magic-wand-guidelines', 'Custom legacy prompt content')`
3. Reload the page
4. **Expected**: A "Custom (Migrated)" prompt should appear and be selected
5. Magic wand should use the migrated content

## Key Files Modified
- `src/hooks/useMagicWand.ts` - Added localStorage listeners and custom events
- `src/router/AppRouter.tsx` - Updated handlePromptSelect to sync activePromptId
- `src/components/TreeControls.tsx` - Updated handlePromptSelect to sync activePromptId

## Technical Details
- Uses `window.addEventListener('storage')` for cross-tab synchronization
- Uses custom `promptCollectionChanged` events for same-tab communication
- Properly updates both local state and localStorage when prompts are selected
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing prompt system

## Success Criteria
✅ Magic wand uses the correct active prompt regardless of selection method
✅ Prompt selection is synchronized across all components
✅ No compilation or runtime errors
✅ Existing functionality remains intact
