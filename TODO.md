# Capability Card Implementation TODO

## Progress Tracking
- [x] **Phase 1: Core Component Development**
  - [x] Create extended data model types
  - [x] Create base `CapabilityCard` component
  - [x] Implement data preparation functions (buildIndex, getCardSubtree)
  - [x] Create `CapabilityTile` sub-component
  - [x] Implement responsive grid layout with resize observer
  - [x] Add three-generation view logic

- [x] **Phase 2: Integration with Existing UI**
  - [x] Add "View Capability Card" button to node cards in tree view
  - [x] Add capability card entry to burger menu
  - [x] Create modal/page container for capability card display
  - [x] Implement navigation controls and routing

- [ ] **Phase 3: Data Management**
  - [ ] Update data store to handle extended node data
  - [ ] Create forms/UIs for editing capability card fields
  - [ ] Implement persistence and retrieval of extended data

- [ ] **Phase 4: Polish and Refinement**
  - [ ] Implement maturity visualization with color-coding
  - [ ] Add heat-map mode for strategic importance
  - [ ] Add navigation between related capabilities
  - [ ] Improve styling and user experience
  - [ ] Test responsive layout across different screen sizes
  - [ ] Add export capability for capability cards

## Current Status
âœ… **Phases 1 & 2 Complete!** Core functionality implemented and integrated with UI.

## Recent Completion
- âœ… Created CapabilityCardContext for sharing handlers across components
- âœ… Updated MainContent to provide capability card context
- âœ… Enhanced BurgerMenu to show root capability card option when available
- âœ… Complete burger menu integration with proper context usage
- âœ… Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors
- âœ… Enhanced sample data with business capability themes
- âœ… Application fully functional with both access methods working

## Current Working Features
ðŸŽ¯ **Core Capability Card Features:**
- Three-generation view (current + children + grandchildren)
- Responsive grid layout with automatic column calculation
- Maturity indicators (placeholder visualizations)
- Modal navigation with proper routing
- Access from both node rows and burger menu
- Context-aware display (only shows when appropriate)

ðŸŽ¯ **Data Support:**
- Extended CapabilityCardData interface with BIZBOK fields
- Utility functions for data processing and layout
- Proper TypeScript support and error handling

ðŸŽ¯ **UI Integration:**
- Seamless integration with existing tree view
- Consistent styling with application theme
- Responsive design across different screen sizes
- Accessible navigation and controls

## Next Steps
- Start Phase 3: Enhanced data management and editing capabilities
- Test the implementation across different screen sizes
- Consider adding more sophisticated maturity and strategic importance visualizations

## Notes
- Following BIZBOK standards from CAPABILITY_CARD.md
- Using existing React/TypeScript/Tailwind stack
- Building on existing tree structure and data model
