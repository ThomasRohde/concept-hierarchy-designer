# Product Requirements Document - Offline PWA & Cloud Sync

## Overview
Transform the application into a full Progressive Web App (PWA) that works offline and seamlessly syncs data across devices when connectivity is available. Users can install the app on desktop or mobile and continue editing even without an internet connection.

## Goals
- Implement a service worker for offline caching of assets and data
- Provide background synchronization of changes when the network is restored
- Enable optional account-based login so trees can sync to the cloud
- Offer install prompts on supported browsers for a native-like experience

## Non-Goals
- Advanced mobile-only features such as push notifications
- Complex multi-factor authentication schemes

## User Stories
1. **As a user**, I can install the app on my phone or desktop and use it offline.
2. **As a user**, my edits made offline automatically sync to my account when I reconnect.
3. **As a user**, I can log in on a different device and see my most recent trees.
4. **As a user**, I receive a clear indicator when the app is offline or syncing.

## Functional Requirements
- Service worker setup using Workbox or similar for asset caching and offline mode.
- Local data store (IndexedDB) to queue changes while offline.
- Background sync API to push updates to the server when online.
- Simple authentication mechanism (OAuth or email link) to tie data to a user account.
- Conflict handling rules when two devices edit the same tree offline.

## UX Considerations
- Visible offline indicator and manual "sync now" action.
- Install instructions or button per browser standards.
- Graceful degradation for browsers that do not support service workers.

## Success Metrics
- Users can open and edit trees with no network connection for at least 24 hours.
- Sync completes successfully within 5 seconds of regaining connectivity (for small changes).
- Increase in returning mobile users as measured by PWA installs and active syncs.
